# The Design of tEngine

tEngine is a terminal graphic engine that can be accessed with APIs like that of OpenGL.

## Fundamental Design

## Planned Updates

- Add color and costumize output symbol

## Future Improvements

- Shall OOP paradigm be used?
- As of now it is a static library. It should be made into a dynamic library.
- Use `ncurses` for better 'graphics'
