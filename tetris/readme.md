The `main.cpp` file (which is dependent on the `conio.h` file) is a tetris program on terminal. 
It is tested on ubuntu and fedora in gnome-terminal. 
As it uses terminal output, its "graphic performance" depends on the terminal emulator.
On the bottom of the screen the expected landing place for the tetris is shown.
